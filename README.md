# `react-typescript-template`

This is a template project bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/), using [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

CRA by default has some configs that I personally don't like. So, to save time on each new project started, using this template as starter may be helpful. 

Feel free to use this template as you wish.

### Features
- ESLint rule overrides
- Module import path aliases with CRACO
- React-Router dynamic routing
- Axios request/response handlers
- File structures based on MVVM architectural pattern

### Installation
Just run on root folder:
```sh
npm install --force
```
`force` flag must be used because some dependencies see to be conflicting.
